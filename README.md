# Light-Responsive-LED-System
In this project, a light sensor continuously measures the ambient light intensity. The
Arduino reads this sensor value and dynamically adjusts the LED blink speed and buzzer
frequency based on the surrounding light conditions. When darkness falls, the LED
illuminates, and the buzzer emits a gentle tone. As daylight returns, the LED turns off,
and the buzzer falls silent. Itâ€™s a smart system that harmonizes with the changing light levels!
