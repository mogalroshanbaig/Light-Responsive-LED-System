# Light-Responsive-LED-System
In this project, a light sensor continuously measures the ambient light intensity. The
Arduino reads this sensor value and dynamically adjusts the LED blink speed and buzzer
frequency based on the surrounding light conditions. When darkness falls, the LED
illuminates, and the buzzer emits a gentle tone. As daylight returns, the LED turns off,
and the buzzer falls silent. It‚Äôs a smart system that harmonizes with the changing light levels!

Project Description:
This project combines a light sensor (photocell), LEDs, and a piezo buzzer.
The LED will increase the brightness when there is no light and viceversa.
The buzzer will beep faster and at a higher pitch with more light and slower and lower pitch with less light.
It‚Äôs a great way to demonstrate your understanding of analog sensors and digital outputs.

Components Needed:
Arduino Uno,
Breadboard,
LED,
Photovoltaic cell (light sensor),
Piezo speaker (buzzer),
Resistors: 2ohm (for LEDs), 2ohm (for photovoltaic cell), and 2ohm (for piezo buzzer).

Wiring Diagram:
Connect the LED to digital pins on the Arduino via 2ohm resistors.
Connect the photovoltaic cell (light sensor) to an analog pin on the Arduino via a 2ohm resistor.
Connect the piezo buzzer to another digital pin on the Arduino (via a 2ohm resistor).

How It Works:
The light sensor measures the ambient light intensity.
The Arduino reads the sensor value and adjusts the LED blink speed and buzzer frequency accordingly.
Experiment with different light conditions to observe the LED and buzzer behavior.
Remember to adjust the resistor values and pin assignments based on your specific components. Have fun building project, and feel free to customize it further! üõ†Ô∏èüîåüåü
